      <h3>Deep Learning for Cinematic Renderer</h3>
      <p class="info">Research Internship at <a href="https://usa.healthcare.siemens.com">Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc</a><span>&bull;</span><em class="date">July 2016 - Feb 2017</em></p>

      <p>Siemens have developed a <a href="https://www.healthcare.siemens.com/magazine/mso-cinematic-rendering.html">Cinematic Renderer</a> which can render CT or magnetic resonance (MR) images into a both scientific and artistic image. To obtain high-quality image, people have to tune many rendering parameters and this is not very efficient. In this project, we use deep neural network to learn a metric to compare images' visual effect to search for best parameter settings. Furthermore, we design a feature extractor to map rendered images into a semantic embeddings. Unlike other metric learning model, our model is unsupervised, which does not need human annotation. All we need is a simple perceptual image metric that works on registered images, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing">perceptual hash</a>.</p>

      <p>We plan to write a paper based on this work and submit to <a href="http://www.miccai2017.org">MICCAI 2017</a>. At present, published report is not available.</p>

      <h3>Optimization Methods for Recurrent Neural Networks by Non-Euclidean Geometry</h3>
      <p class="info">Supervisor: <a href="http://lions.epfl.ch/cms/site/lions2/lang/en/volkan.cevher">Volkan Cevher</a>, Associate Professor of EPFL<span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">January 2016 - Present</em></p>

      <p>Most optimization methods we used in neural network are based on first-order or second-order gradient in Euclidean Geometry. In this project, we propose a novel optimization method called Stochastic Spectral Descent(SSD) which based on Non-Euclidean Geometry, compared with traditional Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD). Actually, SSD is based on infinity-norm geometry. This idea arises from a nice Lipchitz continuity property of log-sum-exp function, which is the loss function of neural network based on cross-entropy loss and softmax classifier. In this project, we apply this technique in the recurrent neural network, which has broad application and is relatively difficult to train.</p>

      <p>You can refer to the progressive report of this project (<a href="../doc/Report_MainBody.pdf">MainBody</a> and <a href="../doc/Report_Appendix.pdf">Appendix</a>) to know more about it. The figure below vividly shows how SGD and SSD update paramters in Euclidean and infinity-norm geometry respectively.</p>

      <h3>Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classification</h3>
      <p class="info">Supervisor: <a href="http://xlhu.cn">Xiaolin Hu</a>, Associate Professor of Tsinghua<span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">December 2014 - July 2015</em></p>

      <p>Recently, convolutional neural network(CNN) has achieved great success in areas such as pattern recognition because of its fewer parameters and power to extract hierarchical features. By adding recurrent connections in CNN, the model called recurrent convolutional neural network(RCNN) can even extract hierarchical features within a layer. RCNN has already shown state-of-art poformance in object recognition. My work is to apply this technology to the field of NLP to solve the problem of sentence classification. Unlike objection recognition, I will build a new model combined classic CNN, RCNN and MLP to complete this task. This is partly because of the latent representation of words and flexible length of sentences.</p>
      <p> This project is the base of my <a href="../doc/ThuThesis.pdf"> bachelor thesis </a>(in Chinese). There is also a <a href="../doc/RCNNSentence.pdf">short summary report</a> of this project in English</p>

      <h3>Class-Based Summarization of Chinese Microblogs</h3>
      <p class="info">Supervisor: <a href="http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224234620586482312/20101224234620586482312_.html">Hua Xu</a>, Associate Professor of Tsinghua<span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">March 2014 - July 2014</em></p>

      <p>
      In times of big data, there are millions of Chinese microblogs (also known as weibo) posted every day. It is necessary to generate summarizations of these microblogs automatically. However, many developed systems and algorithms like The Phrase Reinforcement and Hybrid TF-IDF whose target language is English performs poorly in Chinese corpus, because much more different or informal expression in weibo delivering the same meaning weaken the power of words-cooccurence-based algorithms. This research focuses on designing a class-based algorithm to generate summaries of Chinese microblogs. It firstly uses machine learning algorithms such as LogicLDA and Word2Vec to distribute words into classifications in which words deliver the same meaning. Then we use a tree pattern reinforcement algorithms to generate summaries based on the classification in the first step.</p>
